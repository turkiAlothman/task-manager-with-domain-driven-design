domain drevien design:

1- domain layer: fucos on data persistence and how the  data manupilation  and database schema shoud be . 
	rules:
		- this layer connot reference any other layers
	
	internal components:
		- repository interfaces
		- factories
		- aggrigations
		- domain services

2- application layer: a set of application services. orchesterator of our system
	- the majoraty of the use cases in this layer


3- infrustructure layer: related to anything about exernal systems(databases, storage,emailing , redis ,)

4- presentation layer: entry point to out system. contains endpoints that allow outer users to use our system trough.
	it could be:
		- restfull  api(s)
		- view controllers
		- RPC



the main goal of the repository is the abstraction of datbases manupilation logic.
but some orginixations can do without repositories  with help of entity framework since entity framework already has high level of abstraction
